# delivery-manager
Want to do accept deliveries online? This is the `delivery-manager`, which allows store owners/employees to see the status of their orders, update statuses, and cancel/refund orders. All powered by [BuiltOn.Dev](https://builton.dev).

## Allows admins/store managers to:
- [ ] Get SMS notifications when there are new orders/cancellations
- [ ] View orders & update order status
- [ ] Cancel and refund orders

## This also adds additional features to my [donut-delivery](https://github.com/bpmct/donut-delivery) frontend app:
- [ ] Manage site config (no need to mess with JSON files)
- [ ] Send SMS notifications to users with their order status
- [ ] Allow non-authenticated users to see the status of orders made from different computers/sessions
